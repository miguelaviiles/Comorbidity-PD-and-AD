# Protein Sequence Analysis of ADâ€“PD Comorbidity

This repository investigates molecular features underlying the **comorbidity between Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)**.  
The analysis focuses on **intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)**, **short linear motifs (SLiMs)**, and **genetic variants** in disease-associated proteins.

## Project Structure
- `Commorbidity_PD_AD.ipynb` â†’ Main Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis workflow.  
- `VDA_Disgenet_Alzheimer.tsv` â†’ Geneâ€“disease associations for AD.  
- `VDA_Disgenet_Parkinson.tsv` â†’ Geneâ€“disease associations for PD.  
- `human_proteome.tsv` â†’ Reference dataset for all human proteins.  

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Standard scientific libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `biopython`)  

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
